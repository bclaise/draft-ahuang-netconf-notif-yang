      <t>This document defines an extensible structure for YANG-Push Notification
      to be used in NETCONF environments.
      The definition of this YANG model allows the encoding of YANG-Push Notifications
      in any YANG compatible encodings such as XML, JSON or CBOR.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>YANG-Push <xref target="RFC8639"/> allow NETCONF 
      <xref target="RFC6241"/> servers and YANG-Push publishers to send notifications to
      a data collection. The NETCONF client and the YANG-Push receiver decodes the message
      and optionally validates the header and the content before forwarding to the next process.
      </t>

      <t>The notification container from YANG-Push was defined based on the XML model 
      from NETCONF Event Notifications <xref target="RFC5277"/>. This model only has a
      single mandatory "eventTime" leaf and does offer a way to extend this header with new metadata.
      Additionally, this XML model is only valid for XML-based environments. When messages
      are encoded in other YANG encodings, such as JSON <xref target="RFC7951"/> or CBOR
      <xref target="RFC9254"/>, validators cannot use YANG to validate
      the message schema.</t>

      <t>When a network engineer receives notifications, key metadata is required to provide
      message context. Information such as the hostname of the network node which published the notification
      and the time the events or metrics were observed helps network engineers to correlate with other
      Network Telemetry <xref target="RFC9232"/> data collected through other protocols.
      </t>

      <t>For such reasons, this document proposes the following.
      First, it provides an extensible YANG notification header allowing implementors and IETF contributors
      to easily add new metadata to the notification message.
      Second, it provides the first crucial extensions enabling operators to identify which network node
	  publishes which YANG-Push messages and when the events or metrics were observed on the network node.
      And finally, it provides a way to enable and disable these extensions on a subscription basis, 
      making the coexistence of different YANG-Push and NETCONF Event Notification <xref target="RFC5277"/>
      possible.</t>
      <!-- <t>The structure of a NETCONF Event notification has been
      defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> using a XML Schema 
      <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20001006"/> allowing NETCONF nodes
      to validate the header schema of the notification message when it is encoded in XML.
      However, when these notifications are sent using YANG-Push
      <xref target="RFC8639"/><xref target="RFC8641"/>, they can be encoded in other
      encodings such as JSON <xref target="RFC7951"/> or CBOR <xref target="RFC9254"/>.
      In such cases, the model defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> cannot be used to
      validate the notification header.
      </t> -->

      <!-- <t>This document defines the content of the header of such notifications
      allowing implementations to validate the schema of the notifications when they are encoded

    <section anchor="overview" title="Solution">

      <t>Section 4.2.10 of <xref target="RFC7950"/> defines the encoding of YANG Notifications.
      A YANG Notification is created by defining a 'notification' statement in the YANG module.
      When a NETCONF server sends this notification, it is composed of two parts: a header
      containing metadata which encapsulates the content and the content defined by the 'notification'
      statement.</t>
      
      <t>In YANG 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950"/>, the Notification header is based on the model
      defined in <xref target="RFC5277"/> which contains a single metadata 'eventTime'
      leaf. An example extracted from <xref target="RFC7950"/> is shown in the following XML:</t>

      <sourcecode type="xml"><![CDATA[
  <notification
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0">
    <eventTime>2007-09-01T10:00:00Z</eventTime>
    <link-failure xmlns="urn:example:system">
      <if-name>so-1/2/3.0</if-name>
      <if-admin-status>up</if-admin-status>
      <if-oper-status>down</if-oper-status>
    </link-failure>
  </notification>
]]></sourcecode>

      <t>This document defines a new notification header and enables
      extending it with new metadata.
      The Notification header defined in the following sections is to be used in YANG-Push
      <xref target="RFC8641"/> environments and
      can be both implemented with NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.</t>
      
      <t><xref target="enable-notif"/> defines how a client enables the header defined in this document.
      <xref target="discovery-notif"/> extends the model from <xref target="RFC9196"/> to enable NETCONF
      clients to discover the capability of using the new notification header.
      Lastly, <xref target="encodings-notif"/> defines the new notification header and how
      it is encoded using XML, JSON and CBOR.</t>

	    <section title="Support of Hostname and Sequencing in YANG Notifications">

        <t>When YANG-Push Notification messages are forwarded from a
        receiver to another system, such as a message broker or a time series
        database, the transport context is lost since it is not part of the
        metadata of the notification container. Therefore, the downstream
        system is unable to associate the message to the publishing process (the
        exporting network node), nor able to detect message loss or reordering.</t>

        <t>To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
        described in <xref section="3.1" target="RFC9232"/> or among different
        YANG-Push subscription types as defined in <xref section="3.1"
        target="RFC8641"/>, a reference to the node streaming the data is
        needed. This is essential for understanding the timely relationship
        among these different planes and YANG-Push subscription types.</t>

        <t>Today, network operators work around this impediment by preserving
        the transport source IP address and sequence numbers of the publishing
        process. However, this implies encoding this information in the YANG-Push
	      Notification messages which impacts the semantic readability of the
        message in the downstream system.</t>

        <t>On top of that, the transport source IP address might not represent
        the management IP address by which the YANG-Push publisher should be
        known. In other terms, the source-host <xref target="RFC6470"/>, which
        is the "Address of the remote host for the session" might not be the
        management IP address.</t>

        <t>To overcome these issues, this document proposes a notification
          container extension with a hostname and a sequence number. This allows
          the downstream system to not only be able to identify from which network
          node, subscription, and time the message was published but also, the order
          of the published messages.</t>	

        <dl>
          <dt>hostname:</dt>

          <dd>Describes the node's hostname according to the
          'sysName' object definition in <xref target="RFC1213"/> from where the
          message was published from. This value is usually configured on the
          node by the administrator to uniquely identify the node in the
          network.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>sequence-number:</dt>

          <dd>Generates a unique sequence number for each published message by
          the publisher process. The number counts up at every published
          notification message as described in <xref target="RFC9187"/>.</dd>
        </dl>

        </section>	

	    <section title="Support of Observation Time in YANG Notifications">

        <t>To correlate network data among different Network Telemetry planes as
        described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC9232"/> or among different
        YANG-Push subscription types defined in Section 3.1 of <xref
        target="RFC8641"/>, observation-timestamp describes when the state
        change was observed or when the data was accounted. This is essential
        for understanding the timely relationship among these different planes
        and YANG push subscription types.</t>

        <t>With above described hostname and sequence-number extensions the delay
        between the YANG Notification export and the arrival at the downstream
        system storing the data can be measured. With observation-timestamp, the 
        delay between the time of the network observation and the data export of
        the YANG push publisher process can be measured as well, extending the
        delay measurement scope from the time the network observation and storing
        the data.</t>

        <t>When the time bucket length in a time series database and the
        periodical YANG push subscription time is identical, the eventTime of
        the netconf notification message header is used for indexing, there is
        variable delay between the observation-timestamp and the event-time, and
        the anchor-time as described in Section 4.2 of <xref target="RFC8641"/>
        is close to the time bucket boundaries, a time bucket is going to have
        periodically 0 or 2 measurements indexed instead of 1. Leading to
        inconsistent accounting errors in the time series database. This problem
        is resolved by using the observation-timestamp instead of the event-time
        for time series database indexing.</t>

        <t>By extending YANG-Push Notifications with the observation-timestamp
        YANG object and a observation-point-in-time enumeration for streaming update
        YANG-Push notifications it is ensured that the observation-timestamp is
        always present with the best available time, it can be therefore used
        unconditionally in the data processing chain and with the 
        observation-point-in-time enumeration there is semantic describing at
        which point in time the observation-timestamp was observed.</t>
		
        <dl>
          <dt>observation-timestamp:</dt>

          <dd>
            <t>States the measurement observation time for the "push-update"
            notification in a "periodical" and for the "push-change-update"
            notification in a "on-change" subscription.</t>

            <t>By comparing the observation-timestamp of two "push-update"
            notifications in a periodical subscription, the collector can deduce
            the actual cadence of the measurements, and compare it with the
            subscription configuration. In case of an "on-change" subscription
            it states the time when the network state change was observed.</t>
          </dd>

          <dt>observation-point-in-time:</dt>

          <dd>
            <t>The enumeration states at which point in time the value of the
            observation-timestamp was observed. Choices are:</t>

            <t>current-accounting states for "periodical" subscriptions, the
            point-in-time where the metrics are being polled and observed.</t>

            <t>initial-state states for "on-change sync on start" subscriptions,
            the initial point in time when the subscription was established and
            the state was observed.</t>

            <t>state-changed states for "on-change" and "on-change sync on
            start" subscriptions, the point in time when the state change was
            observed after the subscription was established.</t>
